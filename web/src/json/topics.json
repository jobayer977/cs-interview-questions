As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.\n","section":"What Is Angular?","source":"https://www.simplilearn.com/"}],"What are the core building block of angular":[{"title":"What are the core building block of angular","content":"\nThe various building blocks of Angular are:\n\n- Components\n- Modules\n- Directives\n- Decorators\n- Pipes\n- Data Binding\n- Templates\n- Metadata\n- Services\n- Dependency Injection\n","section":"What are the core building block of angular","source":"https://angular.io"}],"What is Components?":[{"title":"What is Components?","content":"\nIn Angular, Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app. An Angular app contains a tree of Angular components. Angular components are a subset of directives, always associated with a template. Unlike other directives, only one component can be instantiated for a given element in a template.\n\n- Components are typically custom HTML elements, and each of these elements can instantiate only one component.\n- A TypeScript class is used to create a component. This class is then decorated with the `@Component` decorator. The decorator accepts a metadata object that gives information about the component.\n- A component must belong to the NgModule in order for it to be usable by another component or application.\n- Components control their runtime behavior by implementing Life-Cycle hooks.\n\n**Example of an Component**\n\n```TypeScript\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'Angular';\n}\n```\n","section":"What is Components?","source":"https://angular.io"}],"What is TypeScript and why it is used?":[{"title":"What is TypeScript and why it is used?","content":"\nTypeScript is a programming language first developed by Microsoft in 2012. Its main ambition is to improve the productivity of developing complex applications.\nIt is an open-source language developed as a superset of JavaScript. What this means in simple terms is that any code valid in JavaScript is also valuable for TypeScript.\n\n### Example\n\n**Without typescript**\n\n```js\nvar x = 1\nvar y = 2\n```\n\n**With typescript**\n\n```ts\nvar x: number = 1\nvar y: number = 2\n```\n","section":"What is TypeScript and why it is used?","source":"https://www.codemotion.com/"}],"Why Angular?":[{"title":"Why Angular?","content":"\nJavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications. But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not. These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development, Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when using JavaScript on its own.\n\nAngular Provide a collection of integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including: routing forms management client server communication and more. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible so take advantage of the latest features development tools and libraries.\n","section":"Why Angular?","source":"https://www.simplilearn.com/"}]}
